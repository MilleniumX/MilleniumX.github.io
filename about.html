      <h2><strong>About Millenium X</strong></h2>
      <p>We are <strong>Millennium X</strong> and have five members: <strong>Finn, Jedd, Yonal, Cooper and Braydon.</strong> We formed the band a couple of years ago through school and have been practising together ever since. As a band we started performing in front of small audiences consisting of parents and pupils before progressing onto larger school concerts and the Bucks Music Service Battle of the Bands competition. We have a wide array of rock music influences including Bon Jovi, The Killers, Iron Maiden and The Arctic Monkeys.</p>
